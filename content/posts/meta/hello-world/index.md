The world certainly does not need another tech blog. Nor do I necessarily have many particularly insightful or revolutionary thoughts. But the beauty of the internet is that everyone has a chance to scream into the void, regardless of the quality of their work or veracity of their claims.

With that being said, I've spent countless hours reading others' thoughts—obscure tutorials, random notes on niche problems, strangers' opinions on the internet. I've always appreciated this vast ocean of information in the technology and software spaces, and I feel compelled to contribute to it, in whatever inconsequential way that might be.

And so, here are my screams into the void, my output to `/dev/null`. Random bytes flung into the abyss. Maybe there'll be something interesting or helpful to someone here.
